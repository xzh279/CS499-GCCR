Today, I learned how to use Git and Github. I find that Github is an useful tool which we can share our ideas and project with others. Meanwhile, others can look through what I pubilsh. There are lots of great programmers all over the world, they will make change to my code if they find there is a better way that make it works. By this way, I can learn how to coding from them and imporove myself. This is the power of sharing!

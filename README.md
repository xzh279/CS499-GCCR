Today, I learned how to use Git and Github. I find that Github is an useful tool which we can share our ideas and project with others.  There are lots of great programmers all over the world,when they look through what I pubilsh, they will make change to my code if they find there is a better way that make it works. By this way, I can learn how to coding from them and imporove myself. This is the power of sharing! Besides, This is a good way to storage your works here.
